## üöÄ Portfolio Project:

Welcome to my portfolio project showcasing my skills as a FullStack Web Developer! This interactive portfolio is built with cutting-edge technologies, including Three.js and React Three Fiber for immersive 3D graphics. The frontend is powered by React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, offering a seamless and responsive user experience. Dive into the world of web development through my projects and explore the visually appealing design enhanced with Spline animations. Let's connect the dots of creativity and code!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its declarative and efficient component-based architecture.

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications, offering a seamless developer experience.

- Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
